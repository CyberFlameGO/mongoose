MCU    MIMXRT1021DAG5A
Board  IMXRT1020-EVK
Build  Baremetal using MG_TCPIP stack

	Boot section

	The i.MX-RT1020-EVK board has 8mb of external flash (NOR QSPI).
	In order to make program in this area proper boot, a specific
	procedure/header has to be provided.

	For reference, see SDK examples or Segger sources linked below.

	Todo

	- Boot section (link.ld, build) is not complete with regards to
	    QSPI flash program boot/run. We observe JLINK "Invalid flash
	    header" and PC to remain in ROM region (0x0020_0000 - 0x0021
	    _FFFF). A valid header/boot code is provided from Segger for
	    reference example (see below).
	‐ Complete no‐sdk init (peripherals, clocks)
	‐ Complete no‐sdk calls (serial com, gpio)
	- Clean: fsl directory can go. Kept for reference only, until
	    baremetal is complete.

	Info

	This example is a Port  work in progress  from the fully functio‐
	nal IDE/semi-SDK based raw MG_TCPIP driver example at https://gi‐
	thub.com/mongoose‐examples/nxp‐evkmimxrt1020‐mip‐baremetal
	
	This example uses the baremetal driver and relies  on  SDK  func‐
	tions to setup peripheral and clocks. It builds under MCU Expres‐
	so.
