QSPI support

The RT1020 does not come with internal flash but with external flash connected to the FlexSPI bus, only. The external FlexSPI controller allows to connect several different flash types like QSPI and HyperFlash. Furthermore, the external flash can be connected to different pin / ports of the FlexSPI controller which makes a auto-detection very difficult thus a out-of-the-box solution which works for all setups is kind of impossible. For that reason, the J-Link software supports the evaluation board setup, only [...]
