Booting from flash on i.MX RT1020-EVK

	The MIMX1020RT-EVK is configurd to boot from external flash
	(QSPI NOR flash, size 8M) by default. When it is required to
	boot from flash, it will init in ROM region 0x2000_0000 and
	goes through configration/validation calls.

QSPI support

The RT1020 does not come with internal flash but with external flash connected to the FlexSPI bus, only. The external FlexSPI controller allows to connect several different flash types like QSPI and HyperFlash. Furthermore, the external flash can be connected to different pin / ports of the FlexSPI controller which makes a auto-detection very difficult thus a out-of-the-box solution which works for all setups is kind of impossible. For that reason, the J-Link software supports the evaluation board setup, only [...]
