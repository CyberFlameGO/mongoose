MCU    MIMXRT1021DAG5A
Board  IMXRT1020-EVK
Build  Baremetal using MG_TCPIP stack

Todo

‐ Finalyze the linker/load stage
    Issue:  upon  start/reset,  PC will points to and remain into
    the ROM region 0x0020_0000‐0x0021_FFFF.
‐ Complete no‐sdk initializations (peripherals, clocks)
‐ Complete no‐sdk implementation (serial com, gpio)
- Clean files: most if not all of the FSL folder files can go
- Few other header/src files might go too (remain board/mcu
  and CMSIS)

Info

This example is a Port  work in progress  from the fully functio‐
nal IDE/semi-SDK based raw MG_TCPIP driver example at https://gi‐
thub.com/mongoose‐examples/nxp‐evkmimxrt1020‐mip‐baremetal

This example uses the baremetal driver and relies  on  SDK  func‐
tions to setup peripheral and clocks. It builds under MCU Expres‐
so.
